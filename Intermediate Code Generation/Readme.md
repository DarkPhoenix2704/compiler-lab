#  Intermediate Code Generation - Algorithm

1. Open the input file "input.txt" fo[r reading.](http://reading.Open)
2. Open the output file "output.txt" for writing.
3. While there are still lines in the input file: a. Read the next line from the input file, extracting operation, operand1, operand2, and resultVar. b. If the operation is addition ("+"): i. Write to the output file: "Move the value of operand1 to register R0". ii. Write to the output file: "Add the value of operand2 to register R0". iii. Write to the output file: "Move the value in register R0 to resultVar". c. If the operation is multiplication ("\*"): i. Write to the output file: "Move the value of operand1 to register R0". ii. Write to the output file: "Multiply the value of operand2 with the value in register R0". iii. Write to the output file: "Move the result to resultVar". d. If the operation is subtraction ("-"): i. Write to the output file: "Move the value of operand1 to register R0". ii. Write to the output file: "Subtract the value of operand2 from the value in register R0". iii. Write to the output file: "Move the result to resultVar".
4. Close the input file.
5. Close the output file.
